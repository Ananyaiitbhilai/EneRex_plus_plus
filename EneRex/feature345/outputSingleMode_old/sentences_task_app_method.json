        "The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection .",
        "We note that SPP has several remarkable properties for deep CNNs : 1 ) SPP is able to generate a fixedlength output regardless of the input size , while the sliding window pooling used in the previous deep networks   # b2   can not ; 2 ) SPP uses multi-level spatial bins , while the sliding window pooling uses only a single window size .",
        "SPP-net also shows great strength in object detection .",
        "But the feature computation in R-CNN is time-consuming , because it repeatedly applies the deep convolutional networks to the raw pixels of thousands of warped regions per image .",
        "The resulting SPP-net shows outstanding accuracy in classification/detection tasks and greatly accelerates DNN-based detection ."
