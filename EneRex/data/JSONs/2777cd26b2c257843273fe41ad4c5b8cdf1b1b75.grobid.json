        "title": "Understanding Humans in Crowded Scenes: Deep Nested Adversarial Learning and A New Benchmark for Multi-Human Parsing",
        "abstract": "Despite the noticeable progress in perceptual tasks like detection, instance segmentation and human parsing, computers still perform unsatisfactorily on visually understanding humans in crowded scenes, such as group behavior analysis, person re-identification and autonomous driving, etc. To this end, models need to comprehensively perceive the semantic information and the differences between instances in a multi-human image, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task. In this paper, we present a new large-scale database \"Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)\" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-ofthe-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "One of the primary goals of intelligent human-computer interaction is understanding the humans in visual scenes. It  at a coarse, bounding box level (Fig. 1 (a)), instance segmentation, i.e. labelling each pixel of each person uniquely (Fig. 1 (b)), and human parsing, i.e. decomposing persons into their semantic categories (Fig. 1 (c)). Recently, deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable sucess in these perceptual tasks thanks to the availability of plentiful annotated images for training and evaluation purposes  #b7  #b8  #b12  #b24 . Though exciting, current progress is still far from the utimate goal of visually understanding humans. As Fig. 1 shows, previous efforts on understanding humans in visual scenes either only consider coarse information or are agnostic to different instances. In the real-world scenarios, it is more likely that there simutaneously exist multiple persons, with various human interactions, poses and occlusion. Thus, it is more practically demanded to parse human body parts and fashion items at the instance level, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task  #b19 . Multihuman parsing enables more detailed understanding of humans in crowded scenes and aligns better with many real-world applications, such as group behavior analysis  #b10 , person re-identification  #b38 , e-commerce  #b30 , image editing  #b33 , video surveillance  #b4 , autonomous driving  #b5  and virtual reality  #b23 . However, the existing benchmark datasets  #b7  #b8  #b12  #b24  are not suitable for such a new task. Even though Li et al.  #b19  proposed a preliminary Multi-Human Parsing (MHP v1.0) dataset, it only contains 4,980 images annotated with 18 semantic labels. In this work, we propose a new large-scale benchmark \"Multi-Human Parsing (MHP v2.0)\", aiming to push the frontiers of multi-human parsing research towards holistically understanding humans in crowded scenes. The data in MHP v2.0 cover wide variability and complexity w.r.t. viewpoints, poses, occlusion, human interactions and background. It in total includes 25,403 human images with pixel-wise annotations of 58 semantic categories.We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for solving the challenging multi-human parsing problem. Unlike most existing methods  #b15  #b19  #b20  which rely on separate stages of instance localization, human parsing and result refinement, the proposed NAN parses semantic categories and differentiates different person instances simultaneously in an effective and time-efficient manner. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. Each sub-task is simpler than the original multi-human parsing task, and is more easily addressed by the corresponding sub-net. Unlike many multi-task learning applications, in our method the sub-nets depend on each other, forming a causal nest by dynamically boosting each other through an adversarial strategy (See Fig. 4), which is hence called a \"nested adversarial learning\" structure. Such a structure enables effortless gradient BackproPagation (BP) in NAN such that it can be trained in a holistic, end-to-end way, which is favorable to both accuracy and speed. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on the MHP v2.0 dataset proposed in this work and the MHP v1.0  #b19  benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate the superiority of NAN on multi-human parsing over the state-of-the-arts.Our contributions are summarized as follows  ",
        "RELATED WORK": "Human Parsing Datasets. The statistics of popular publicly available datasets for human parsing are summarized in Tab. 1. The Buffy  #b31  dataset was released in 2011 for human parsing and instance segmentation. It contains only 748 images annotated with 13 semantic categories. The Fashionista  #b34  dataset was released in 2012 for human parsing, containing limited images annotated with 56 fashion categories. The PASCAL-Person-Part  #b2  dataset was initially annotated by Chen et al.  #b2  from the PASCAL-VOC-2010  #b9  dataset. Chen et al.  #b1  extended it for human parsing with 7 coarse body part labels. The ATR  #b22  dataset was released in 2015 for human parsing with a large number of images annotated with 18 semantic categories. The LIP  #b12  dataset further extended ATR  #b22  by cropping person instances from Microsoft COCO  #b24 . It is a large-scale human parsing dataset with densely pixel-wise annotations of 20 semantic categories. But it has two limitations. 1) Despite the large data size, it contains limited semantic category annotations, which restricts the fine-grained understanding of humans in visual scenes. 2) In LIP  #b12 , only a small proportion of images involve multiple persons with interactions. Such an instanceagnostic setting severely deviates from reality. Even in the MHP v1.0 dataset proposed by Li et al.  #b19  for multi-human parsing, only 4,980 images are included and annotated with 18 semantic labels. Comparatively, our MHP v2.0 dataset contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic part labels. It is the largest and most comprehensive multi-human parsing dataset to date, to our best knowledge. Visual comparisons between LIP  #b12 , MHP v1.0  #b19  and our MHP v2.0 are provided in Fig. 2.Human Parsing Approaches. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to human parsing [7, 13, 14, 16, 20-22, 26, 38] due to its wide range of potential applications. For example, Liang et al.  #b21  proposed a proposal-free network for instance segmentation by directly predicting the instance numbers of different categories and the pixel-level information. Gong et al.  #b12  proposed a selfsupervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures to parsing results without resorting to extra supervision. Liu et al.  #b25  proposed a single frame video parsing method which integrates frame parsing, optical flow estimation and temporal fusion into a unified network. Zhao et al.  #b37  proposed a self-supervised neural aggregation network, which learns to aggregate the multi-scale features and incorporates a self-supervised joint loss to ensure the consistency between parsing and pose. He et al.  #b13  proposed the Mask R-CNN, which is extended from Faster R-CNN  #b28  by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Brabandere et al.  #b6  proposed to tackle instance segmentation with a discriminative loss function, operating at the pixel level, which encourages a convolutional network to produce a representation of the image that can be easily clustered into instances with a simple post-processing step. However, these methods either only consider coarse semantic information or are agnostic to different instances. To enable more detailed human-centric analysis, Li et al.  #b19  initially proposed the multi-human parsing task, which aligns better with the realistic scenarios. They also proposed a novel MH-Parser model as a reference method which generates parsing maps and instance masks simutaneously in a bottom-up fashion. Jiang et al.  #b15  proposed a new approach to segment human instances and label their body parts using region assembly. Li et al.  #b20  proposed a framework with a human detector and a category-level segmentation module to segment the parts of objects at the instance level. These methods involve mutiple separate stages for instance localization, human parsing and result refinement. In comparison, the proposed NAN produces accurate multi-human parsing results through a single forward-pass in a time-efficient manner without tedious pre-or post-processing.",
        "MULTI-HUMAN PARSING BENCHMARK": "In this section, we introduce the \"Multi-Human Parsing (MHP v2.0)\", a new large-scale dataset focusing on semantic understanding of humans in crowded scenes with several appealing properties. 1) It contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained labels on body parts, fashion items and one background label, which is larger and more comprehensive than previous similar attempts  #b19  #b31 . 2) The images within MHP v2.0 are collected from real-world scenarios, involving humans with various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and resolution. 3) The background of images in MHP v2.0 is more complex and diverse than previous datasets. Some examples are showed in Fig. 2. The MHP v2.0 dataset is expected to provide a new benchmark suitable for multi-human parsing together with a standard evaluation server where the test set will be kept secret to avoid overfitting.",
        "Image Collection and Annotation": "We manually specify some underlying relationships (such as family, couple, team, etc.) and possible scenes (such as sports, conferences, banquets, etc.) to ensure the diversity of returned results. Based on any one of these specifications, corresponding multi-human images are located by performing Internet searches over Creative Commons licensed imagery. For each identified image, the contained human number and the corresponding URL are stored in a spreadsheet. Automated scrapping software is used to download the multi-human imagery and stores all relevant information in a relational database. Moreover, a pool of images containing clearly visible persons with interactions and rich fashion items is also constructed from the existing human-centric datasets  #b3  #b16  #b29  #b35  #b36     After curating the imagery, manual annotation is conducted by professional data annotators, which includes two distinct tasks. The first task is manually counting the number of foreground persons and duplicating each image to several copies according to the count number. Each duplicated image is marked with the image ID, the contained person number and a self-index. The second is assigning the fine-grained pixel-wise label to each semantic category for each person instance. We implement an annotation tool and generate multi-scale superpixels of images based on  #b0  to speed up the annotation. Each multi-human image contains at least two instances. The annotation for each instance is done in a left-to-right order, corresponding to the duplicated image with the self-index from beginning to end. For each instance, 58 semantic categories are defined and annotated, including cap/hat, helmet, face, hair, left-arm, right-arm, left-hand, right-hand, protector, bikini/bra, jacket/windbreaker/hoodie, t-shirt, polo-shirt, sweater, singlet, torsoskin, pants, shorts/swim-shorts, skirt, stockings, socks, left-boot, rightboot, left-shoe, right-shoe, left-highheel, right-highheel, left-sandal, right-sandal, left-leg, right-leg, left-foot, right-foot, coat, dress, robe, jumpsuits, other-full-body-clothes, headwear, backpack, ball, bats, belt, bottle, carrybag, cases, sunglasses, eyewear, gloves, scarf, umbrella, wallet/purse, watch, wristband, tie, other-accessaries, otherupper-body-clothes and other-lower-body-clothes. Each instance has a complete set of annotations whenever the corresponding category appears in the current image. When annotating one instance, others are regarded as background. Thus, the resulting annotation set for each image consists of N instance-level parsing masks, where N is the number of persons in the image.After annotation, manual inspection is performed on all images and corresponding annotations to verify the correctness. In cases where annotations are erroneous, the information is manually rectified by 5 well informed analysts. The whole work took around three months to accomplish by 25 professional data annotators.",
        "Dataset Splits and Statistics": "In total, there are 25,403 images in the MHP v2.0 dataset. Each image contains 2-26 person instances, with 3 on average. The resolution of the images ranges from 85\u00d7100 to 4,511\u00d76,919, with 644\u00d7718 on average. We spit the images into training, validation and testing sets. Following random selection, we arrive at a unique split consisting of 15,403 training and 5,000 validation images with publicly available annotations, as well as 5,000 testing images with annotations withheld for benchmarking purpose.The statistics w.r.t. data distribution on 59 semantic categories, the average semantic category number per image and the average instance number per image in the MHP v2.0 dataset are illustrated in Fig. 3 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. In general, face, arms and legs are the most remarkable parts of a human body. However, understanding humans in crowded scenes needs to analyze finegrained details of each person of interest, including different body parts, clothes and accessaries. We therefore define 11 body parts, and 47 clothes and accessaries. Among these 11 body parts, we divide arms, hands, legs and feet into left and right side for more precise analysis, which also increases the difficulty of the task. We define hair, face and torso-skin as the remaining three body parts, which can be used as auxiliary guidance for more comprehensive instance-level analysis. As for clothing categories, we have common clothes like coat, jacket/windbreaker/hoodie, sweater, singlet, pants, shorts/swim-shorts and shoes, confusing categories such as t-shirt v.s. polo-shirt, stockings v.s. socks, skirt v.s. dress and robe, and boots v.s. sandals and highheels, and infrequent categories such as cap/hat, helmet, protector, bikini/bra, jumpsuits, gloves and scarf. Furthermore, accessaries like sunglasses, belt, tie, watch and bags are also taken into account, which are common but hard to predict, especially for the small-scale ones.To summarize, the pre-defined semantic categories of MHP v2.0 involve most body parts, clothes and accessaries of different styles for men, women and children in all seasons. The images in the MHP v2.0 dataset contain diverse instance numbers, viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background complexities. MHP v2.0 aligns better with real-world scenarios and serves as a more realistic benchmark for human-centric analysis, which pushes the frontiers of fine-grained multi-human parsing research.",
        "DEEP NESTED ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS": "As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model consists of three GAN-like sub-nets that jointly perform semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering end-to-end. NAN produces accurate multihuman parsing results through a single forward-pass in a timeefficient manner without tedious pre-or post-processing. We now present each component in details.",
        "Semantic Saliency Prediction": "Large modality and interaction variations are the main challenge to multi-human parsing and also the key obstacle to learning a wellperforming human-centric analysis model. To address this problem, we propose to decompose the original task into three granularities and adaptively impose a prior on the specific process, each with the aid of a GAN-based sub-net. This reduces the training complexity and leads to better empirical performance with limited data. G.T. The first sub-net estimates semantic saliency maps to locate the most noticeable and eye-attracting human regions in images, which serves as a basic prior to facilitate further processing on humans, as illustrated in Fig. 4 left. We formulate semantic saliency prediction as a binary pixel-wise labelling problem to segment out foreground v.s. background. Inspired by the recent success of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)  #b26  based methods on image-to-image applications  #b13  #b18 , we leverage an FCN backbone (FCN-8s  #b26 ) as the generator G1 \u03b8 1 : R H \u00d7W \u00d7C \u2192 R H \u00d7W \u00d7C \u2032 of NAN for semantic saliency prediction, where \u03b8 1 denotes the network parameters, and H , W , C and C \u2032 denote the image height, width, channel number and semantic category (i.e., foreground plus background) number, repectively.",
        "\u2112--": "Concat Real FakeFormally, let the input RGB image be denoted by x and the semantic saliency map be denoted by x \u2032 , thenx \u2032 := G1 \u03b8 1 (x ).(1)The key requirements for G1 are that the semantic saliency map x \u2032 should present indistinguishable properities compared with a real one (i.e., ground truth) in appearance while preserving the intrinsic contextually remarkable information.To this end, we propose to learn \u03b8 1 by minimizing a combination of two losses:L G1 \u03b8 1 = -\u03bb 1 L adv 1 + \u03bb 2 L ss ,(2)where L adv 1 is the adversarial loss for refining realism and alleviating artifacts, L ss is the semantic saliency loss for pixel-wise image labelling, \u03bb are weighting parameters among different losses.L ss is a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss calculated based on the binary pixel-wise annotations to learn \u03b8 1 :L ss = L ss (X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 )|X ).(3)L adv 1 is proposed to narrow the gap between the distributions of generated and real results. To facilitate this process, we leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone as the discriminator D1 \u03d5 1 : R H \u00d7W \u00d7C \u2032 \u2192 R 1 to be as simple as possible to avoid typical GAN tricks. We alternatively optimize G1 \u03b8 1 and D1 \u03d5 1 to learn \u03b8 1 and \u03d5 1 :L G1 adv 1 = L adv 1 (K (\u03b8 1 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT ), L D1 adv 1 = L adv 1 (K (\u03d5 1 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT ),(4)where K denotes the binary real v.s. fake indicator.",
        "Instance-Agnostic Parsing": "The second sub-net concatenates the information from the original RGB image with semantic saliency prior as input and estimates a fine-grained instance-agnostic parsing map, which further serves as stronger semantic guidance from the global perspective to facilitate instance-aware clustering, as illustrated in Fig. 4 middle. We formulate instance-agnostic parsing as a multi-class dense classification problem to mask semantically consistent regions of body parts and fashion items. Inspired by the leading performance of the skip-net on recognition tasks  #b14  #b32 , we modify a skip-net (WS-ResNet  #b32 ) into an FCN-based architecture as the generator G 2\u03b8 2 : R H \u00d7W \u00d7(C+C \u2032 ) \u2192 R H /8\u00d7W /8\u00d7C \u2032\u2032 of NAN to learn a highly non-linear transformation for instance-agnostic parsing, where \u03b8 2 denotes the network parameters for the generator and C \u2032\u2032 denotes the semantic category number. The prediction is downsampled by 8 for accuracy v.s. speed trade-off. Contextual information from global and local regions compensates each other and naturally benefits human parsing. The hierarchical features within a skip-net are multi-scale in nature due to the increasing receptive field sizes, which are combined together via skip connections. Such a combined representation comprehensively maintains the contextual information, which is crucial for generating smooth and accurate parsing results. Formally, let the instance-agnostic parsing map be denoted by x \u2032\u2032 , thenx \u2032\u2032 := G2 \u03b8 2 (x \u222a x \u2032 ).(5)Similar to the first sub-net, we propose to learn \u03b8 2 by minimizing:L G2 \u03b8 2 = -\u03bb 3 L adv 2 + \u03bb 4 L gp ,(6)where L gp is the global parsing loss for semantic part labelling. L gp is a standard pixel-wise cross-entropy loss calculated based on the multi-class pixel-wise annotations to learn \u03b8 2 . \u03b8 1 is also slightly finetuned due to the hinged gradient backpropagation route within the nested structure:L gp = L gp (X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ) |X \u222a X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 )).(7)L adv 2 is proposed to ensure the correctness and realism of the current phase and also the previous one for information flow consistency. To facilitate this process, we leverage a same CNN backbone with D1 \u03d5 1 as the discriminator D2 \u03d5 2 : R H \u00d7W \u00d7(C \u2032 +C \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 R 1 , which are learned separately. We alternatively optimize G2 \u03b8 2 and D2 \u03d5 2 to learn \u03b8 2 , \u03d5 2 and slightly finetune \u03b8 1 :L G2 adv 2 = L adv 2 (K (\u03b8 2 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT \u222a X \u2032\u2032 GT ), L D2 adv 2 = L adv 2 (K (\u03d5 2 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT \u222a X \u2032\u2032 GT ). (8)",
        "Instance-Aware Clustering": "The third sub-net concatenates the information from the original RGB image with semantic saliency and instance-agnostic parsing priors as input and estimates an instance-aware clustering map by associating each semantic parsing mask to one of the person instances in the scene, as illustrated in Fig. 4 right. Inspired by the observation that a human glances at an image and instantly knows how many and where the objects are in the image, we formulate instance-aware clustering by parallelly inferring the instance number and pixel-wise instance location, discarding the requirement of time-consuming region proposal generation. We modify a same backbone architecture G2 \u03b8 2 to incorporate two sibling branches as the generator G 3\u03b8 3 : R H /8\u00d7W /8\u00d7(C+C \u2032 +C \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 R H /8\u00d7W /8\u00d7M \u222a R 1 of NAN for location-sensitive learning, where \u03b8 3 denotes the network parameters for the generator and M denotes the pre-defined instance location coordinate number. As multi-scale features integrating both global and local contextual information are crucial for increasing location prediction accuracy, we further augment the pixel-wise instance location prediction branch with a Multi-Scale Fusion Unit (MSFU) to fuse shallow-, middle-and deep-level features, while using the feature maps downsampled by 8 concatenated with feature maps from the first branch for instance number regression.Formally, let the pixel-wise instance location map be denoted by x and the instance number be denoted by n, thenx \u222a n := G3 \u03b8 3 (x \u222a x \u2032 \u222a x \u2032\u2032 ).(9)We propose to learn \u03b8 3 by minimizing:L G3 \u03b8 3 = -\u03bb 5 L adv 3 + \u03bb 6 L pil + \u03bb 7 L in ,(10)where L pil is the pixel-wise instance location loss for pixel-wise instance location regression and L in is the instance number loss for instance number regression. L pil is a standard smooth-\u2113 1 loss  #b11  calculated based on the foreground pixel-wise instance location annotations to learn \u03b8 3 . Since a person instance can be identified by its top-left corner (x l , y l ) and bottom-right corner (x r , y r ) of the surrounding bounding box, for each pixel belonging to the person instance, the pixelwise instance location vector is defined as [x l /w, y l /h, x r /w, y r /h], where w and h are the width and height of the person instance for normalization, respectively. L in is a standard \u2113 2 loss calculated based on the instance number annotations to learn \u03b8 3 . \u03b8 2 and \u03b8 1 are also slightly finetuned due to the chained schema within the nest:L pil = L pil ( X (\u03b8 3 , \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 )|X \u222a X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 )), L in = L in (N (\u03b8 3 , \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 )|X \u222a X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 )). (11)Given these information, instance-aware clustering maps can be effortlessly generated with little computational overhead, which are denoted by X \u2208 R M \u2032 . Similar to L adv 2 , L adv 3 is proposed to ensure the correctness and realism of all phases for the information flow consistency. To facilitate this process, we leverage a same CNN backbone with D2 \u03d5 2 as the discriminator D3 \u03d5 3 : R H \u00d7W \u00d7(C \u2032 +C \u2032\u2032 +M \u2032 ) \u2192 R 1 , which are learned separately. We alternatively optimize G3 \u03b8 3 and D3 \u03d5 3 to learn \u03b8 3 , \u03d5 3 and slightly finetune \u03b8 2 and \u03b8 1 :\uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 L G3 adv 3 = L adv 3 (K (\u03b8 3 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ) \u222a X (\u03b8 3 , \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT \u222a X \u2032\u2032 GT \u222a XGT ), L D3 adv 3 = L adv 3 (K (\u03d5 3 )|X \u2032 (\u03b8 1 ) \u222a X \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ) \u222a X (\u03b8 3 , \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 1 ), X \u2032 GT \u222a X \u2032\u2032 GT \u222a XGT ).(12)",
        "Training and Inference": "The goal of NAN is to use sets of real targets to learn three GAN-like sub-nets that mutually boost and jointly accomplish multi-human parsing. Each separate loss serves as a deep supervision within the nested structure benefitting network convergence. The overall objective function for NAN isL NAN = - 3 i =1 \u03bb i L adv i + \u03bb 4 L ss + \u03bb 5 L gp + \u03bb 6 L pil + \u03bb 7 L in .(13)Clearly, the NAN is end-to-end trainable and can be optimized with the proposed nested adversarial learning strategy and BP algorithm.During testing, we simply feed the input image X into NAN to get the instance-agnostic parsing map X \u2032\u2032 from G2 \u03b8 2 , pixel-wise instance location map X and instance number N from G3 \u03b8 3 . Then we employ an off-the-shelf clustering method  #b27  to obtain the instance-aware clustering map X . Example results are visualized in Fig. 5.",
        "EXPERIMENTS": "We evaluate NAN qualitatively and quantitatively under various settings and granularities for understanding humans in crowded scenes. In particular, we evaluate multi-human parsing performance on the MHP v2.0 dataset proposed in this work and the MHP v1.0  #b19  benchmark dataset.",
        "Evaluations on the MHP v2.0 Benchmark": "The MHP v2.0 dataset proposed in this paper is the largest and most comprehensive multi-human parsing benchmark to date, which extends MHP v1.0  #b19  to push the frontiers of understanding humans in crowded scenes by containing 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels. Annotation examples are visualized in Fig. 2 (c). The data are randomly organized into 3 splits, consisting of 15,403 training and 5,000 validation images with publicly available annotations, as well as 5,000 testing images with annotations withheld for benchmarking purpose.

We first investigate different architectures and loss function combinations of NAN to see their respective roles in multi-human parsing. We compare 16 variants from four aspects, i.e., different baselines (Mask R-CNN  #b13   and PCP@IoU=0.5 on the MHP v2.0 validation set is reported in Tab. 2. By comaring the results from the 1 st v.s. 3 r d panels, we observe that our proposed NAN consistently outperforms the baselines Mask R-CNN  #b13  and MH-Parser  #b19  by a large margin, i.e., 10.33% and 6.78% in terms of AP p , 9.26% and 6.90% in terms of AP p vol , and 9.25% and 7.46% in terms of PCP. Mask R-CNN  #b13  suffers difficulties to differentiate entangled humans. MH-Parser  #b19  involves multiple stages for instance localization, human parsing and result refinement with high complexity, yielding sub-optimal results, whereas NAN parses semantic categories, differentiates different person instances and refines results simultaneously through deep nested adversarial learning in an effective yet time-efficient manner. By comaring the results from the 2 nd v.s. 3 r d panels, we observe that NAN consistently outperforms the 9 variants in terms of network structure. In particular, w/o G1 refers to truncating the semantic saliency prediction sub-net from NAN, leading to 2.16%, 4.66% and 2.42% performance drop in terms of all metrics. This verifies the necessity of semantic saliency prediction that locates the most noticeable human regions in images to serve as a basic prior to facilitate further human-centic processing. The superiority of incorporating adaptive prior information to specific process can be verified by comparing Gi, i \u2208 {2, 3} w/o concatenated input with NAN, i.e., 2.95%, 5.98% and 5.35%; 2.47%, 6.85% and 8.89% differences in terms of all metrics. The superiority of incorporating adversarial learning to specific process can be verified by comparing w/o Di, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} with NAN, i.e., 1.02%, 8.82% and 6.78%; 5.81%, 13.11% and 11.48%; 4.21%, 9.94% and 8.15% decrease in terms of all metrics. Nested adversarial learning strategy ensures the correctness and realism of all phases for information flow consistency, the superiority of which is verified by comparing Di, i \u2208 {2, 3} w/o concatenated input with NAN, i.e., 3.28%, 10.83% and 9.47%; 3.03%, 8.23% and 7.07% decline in terms of all metrics. MSFU dynamically fuses multi-scale features for enhancing instance-aware clustering accuracy, the superiority of which is verified by comparing w/o MSFU with NAN, i.e., 6.07%, 16.15% and 9.43% drop in terms of all metrics. Finally, we also evaluate the limitations of our current algorithm. By comparing X \u2032 GT with NAN, only 1.34%, 0.82% and 3.74% improvement in term of all metrics are obtained, which shows that the errors from semantic saliency prediction are already small and have only little effect on the final results. A large gap between 28.98%, 48.55% and 38.03% of X \u2032\u2032 GT and 24.83%, 42.77% and 34.37% of NAN shows that a better instance-agnostic parsing network architecture can definitely help improve the performance of multi-human parsing under our NAN framework. By comparing N GT and XGT with NAN, 3.56%, 4.99% and 4.88%; 5.35%, 8.67% and 6.81% improvement in term of all metrics are obtained, which shows that accurate instance-aware clustering results are critical for superior multi-human parsing.5.1.2 Quantitative Comparison. The performance comparison of the proposed NAN with two state-of-the-art methods in terms of AP p @IoU=0.5, AP p vol and PCP@IoU=0.5 on the MHP v2.0 testing set is reported in Tab. 3. Following  #b19 , we conduct experiments under three settings: All reports the evaluation over the whole testing set; Inter 20% reports the evaluation over the sub-set containing the images with top 20% interaction intensity4 ; Inter 10% reports the evaluation over the sub-set containing the images with top 10% interaction intensity. Our NAN is significantly superior over other state-of-the-arts on setting-1. In particular, NAN improves the 2 nd -best by 7.15%, 5.70% and 5.27% in terms of all metrics. For the more challenging scenarios with intensive interactions (setting-2, 3), NAN also consistently achieves the best performance. In particular, for Inter 20% and Inter 10% , NAN improves the 2 nd -best by 5.23%, 4.65% and 5.62%; 1.63%, 3.20% and 3.33% in terms of all metrics. This verifies the effectiveness of our NAN for multi-human parsing and understanding humans in crowded scenes. Moreover, NAN can rapidly process one 512\u00d7512 image in about 1 second with acceptable resource consumption, which is attractive to real applications. This compares much favorably to MH-Parser  #b19  (14.94 img/s), which relies on separate and complex post-processing (including CRF  #b17 ) steps. 5.1.3 Qualitative Comparison. Fig. 5 visualizes the qualitative comparison of the proposed NAN with two state-of-the-art methods and corresponding ground truths on the MHP v2.0 dataset. Note that Mask R-CNN  #b13  only offers silhouettes of different person instances, we only compare our instance-aware clustering results with it while comparing our holistic results with MH-Parser  #b19 . It can be observed that the proposed NAN performs well in multi-human parsing with a wide range of viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background complexity. The instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering predictions of NAN present high consistency with corresponding ground truths, thanks to the novel network structure and effective training strategy. In contrast, Mask R-CNN  #b13  suffers difficulties to differentiate entangled humans, while MH-Parser  #b19  struggles to generate fine-grained parsing     results and clearly segmented instance masks. This further desmonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed NAN. We also show some failure cases of our NAN in Fig. 6. As can be observed, humans in crowded scenes with heavy occlusion, extreme poses and intensive interactions are difficult to identify and segment. Some small-scale semantic categories within person instances are difficult to parse. This confirms that MHP v2.0 aligns with real-world situations and deserves more furture attention and research efforts.",
        "Evaluations on the MHP v1.0 Benchmark": "The MHP v1.0 5 dataset is the first multi-human parsing benchmark, originally proposed by Li et al.  #b19 , which contains 4,980 images annotated with 18 semantic labels. Annotation examples are visualized in Fig. 2 (b). The data are randomly organized into 3 splits, 5 The dataset is available at http://lv-mhp.github.io/ consisting of 3,000 training, 1,000 validation and 1,000 testing images with publicly available annotations. Evaluation systems report the AP p and PCP over the testing set.The performance comparison of the proposed NAN with three state-of-the-art methods in terms of AP p @IoU=0.5, AP p vol and PCP@IoU=0.5 on the MHP v1.0  #b19  testing set is reported in Tab. 4. With the nested adversarial learning of semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering, our method outperforms the 2 nd -best by 4.41% for AP p 0.5 , 6.95% for AP p vol and 8.04% for PCP 0.5 .",
        "CONCLUSIONS": "In this work, we presented \"Multi-Human Parsing (MHP v2.0)\", a large-scale multi-human parsing dataset and a carefully designed benchmark to spark progress in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP v2.0 contains 25,403 images, which are richly labelled with 59 semantic categories. We also proposed a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model to address this challenging problem and performed detailed evaluations of the proposed method with current state-of-the-arts on MHP v2.0 and several other datasets. We envision the proposed MHP v2.0 dataset and the baseline method would drive the human parsing research towards real-world application scenario with simultaneous presence of multiple persons and complex interactions among them. In future, we will continue to take efforts to construct a more comprehensive multi-human parsing benchmark dataset with more images and more detailed semantic category annotations to further push the frontiers of multi-human parsing research.",
