<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Capturing semantic relations between sentences, such as entailment, is a long-standing challenge for computational semantics. Logic-based models analyse entailment in terms of possible worlds (interpretations, or situations) where a premise P entails a hypothesis H iff in all worlds where P is true, H is also true. Statistical models view this relationship probabilistically, addressing it in terms of whether a human would likely infer H from P. In this paper, we wish to bridge these two perspectives, by arguing for a visually-grounded version of the Textual Entailment task. Specifically, we ask whether models can perform better if, in addition to P and H, there is also an image (corresponding to the relevant "world" or "situation"). We use a multimodal version of the SNLI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref> and we compare "blind" and visually-augmented models of textual entailment. We show that visual information is beneficial, but we also conduct an in-depth error analysis that reveals that current multimodal models are not performing "grounding" in an optimal fashion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Evaluating the ability to infer information from a text is a crucial test of the capability of models to grasp meaning. As a result, the computational linguistics community has invested huge efforts into developing textual entailment (TE) datasets.</p><p>After formal semanticists developed FraCas in the mid '90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1996)</ref>, an increase in statistical approaches to computational semantics gave rise to the need for suitable evaluation datasets. Hence, Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) shared tasks have been organized regularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sammons et al., 2012)</ref>. Recent work on compositional distributional models has motivated the development of the SICK dataset of sentence pairs in entailment relations for evaluating such models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Marelli et al., 2014)</ref>. Further advances with Neural Networks (NNs) have once more motivated efforts to develop a large natural language inference dataset, SNLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>, since NNs need to be trained on big data. However, meaning is not something we obtain just from text and the ability to reason is not unimodal either. The importance of enriching meaning representations with other modalities has been advocated by cognitive scientists, (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrews et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barsalou, 2010)</ref>) and computational linguists (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Glavaš et al., 2017)</ref>). While efforts have been put into developing multimodal datasets for the task of checking Semantic Text Similarity Text <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agirre et al., 2017)</ref>, we are not aware of any available datasets to tackle the problem of Grounded Textual Entailment (GTE). Our paper is a first effort in this direction.</p><p>Textual Entailment is defined in terms of the likelihood of two sentences (a premise P and an hypothesis H) to be in a certain relation: P entails, contradicts or is unrelated to H. For instance, the premise "People trying to get warm in front of a chimney" and the hypothesis "People trying to get warm at home" are highly likely to be in an entailment relation. Our question is whether having an image that illustrates the event (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) can help a model to capture the relation. In order to answer this The inclusion of images can also alter relations which, based on text alone, would seem likely. For example, to a "blind" model the sentences of the sentence pair in Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> would seem to be unrelated, but when the two sentences are viewed in the context of the image, they do become related.</p><p>A suitable GTE model therefore has to perform two sub-tasks: (a) it needs to ground its linguistic representations of P, H or both in non-linguistic (visual) data; (b) it needs to reason about the possible relationship between P and H (modulo the visual information).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Grounding language through vision has recently become the focus of several tasks, including Image Captioning (IC, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hodosh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>) and Visual Question Answering (VQA, eg. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Malinowski and Fritz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Antol et al., 2015)</ref>), and even more recently, Visual Reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Johnson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Suhr et al., 2017)</ref> and Visual Dialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Das et al., 2017)</ref>. Our focus is on Grounded Textual Entailment (GTE). While the literature on TE is rather vast, GTE is still rather unexplored territory.</p><p>Textual Entailment Throughout the history of Computational Linguistics various datasets have been built to evaluate Computational Semantics models on the TE task. Usually they contain data divided into entailment, contradiction or unknown classes. The "unknown" label has sometimes been replaced with the "unrelated" or "neutral" label, capturing slightly different types of phenomena. Interestingly, the "entailment" and "contradiction" classes also differ across datasets. In the mid-'90s a group of formal semanticists developed FraCaS (Framework for Computational Semantics). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1996)</ref>  <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The dataset contains logical entailment problems in which a conclusion has to be derived from one or more premises (but not necessarily all premises are needed to verify the entailment). The entailments are driven by logical properties of linguistic expressions, like the monotonicity of quantifiers, or their conservativity property etc. Hence, the set of premises entails the conclusion iff in all the interpretations (worlds) in which the premises are true the conclusion is also true; otherwise the conclusion contradicts the premises. In 2005, the PASCAL RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) challenge was launched, to become a task organized annually. In 2008, the RTE-4 committee made the task more fine-grained by requiring the classification of the pairs as "entailment", "contradiction" and "unknown" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Giampiccolo et al., 2008)</ref>. The RTE datasets, unlike FraCaS, contain real-life natural language sentences and the sort of entailment problems which occur in corpora collected from the web. Importantly, the sentence pair relations are annotated as entailment, contradiction or neutral based on a likelihood condition: if a human reading the premise would typically infer that the conclusion (called the hypothesis) is most likely true (entailment), its negation is most likely true (contradiction) or the conclusion can be either true or false (neutral).</p><p>At SemEval 2014, in order to evaluate Compositional Distributional Semantics Models focusing on the compositionality ability of those models, the SICK dataset (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge) was used in a shared entailment task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Marelli et al., 2014)</ref>. Sentence pairs were obtained through re-writing rules and annotated with the three RTE labels via a crowdsourcing platform. Both in RTE and SICK the label assigned to the sentence pairs captures the relation holding between the two sentences.</p><p>A different approach has been used to build the much larger SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>: Premises are taken from a dataset of images annotated with descriptive captions; the corresponding hypotheses were produced through crowdsourcing, where for a given premise, annotators provided a sentence which is true or not true with respect to a possible image which the premise could describe. A consequence of this choice is that the contradiction relation can be assigned to pairs which are rather unrelated ("A person in a black wetsuit is surfing a small wave" and "A woman is trying to sleep on her bed"), differently from what happens in RTE and SICK.</p><p>Since the inception of RTE shared tasks, there has been an increasing emphasis on data-driven approaches which, given the hypothesis H and premise P, seek to classify the semantic relation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sammons et al., 2012)</ref> for a review). More recently, neural approaches have come to dominate the scene, as shown by the recent RepEval 2017 task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nangia et al., 2017)</ref>, where all submissions relied on bidirectional LSTM models, with or without pretrained embeddings. RTE also intersects with a number of related inference problems, including semantic text similarity and Question Answering, and some models have been proposed to address several such problems. In one popular approach, both P and H are encoded within the same embedding space, using a single RNN, with a decision made based on the encodings of the two sentences. This is the approach we adopt for our baseline LSTM in Section 4, based on the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bowman et al. (2015)</ref>, albeit with some modifications (see also <ref type="bibr">(Tan et al., 2016)</ref>). A second promising approach, based on which we adapt our state of the art model, relies on matching and aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. Here, the decision concerning the relationship between P and H is based on an aggregate representation achieved after the two sentences are matched. Yet another area where neural approaches are being applied to sentence pairs in an entailment relationship is generation, where an RNN generates an entailed hypothesis (or a chain of such hypotheses) given an encoding of the premise <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kolesnyk et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Starc and Mladenić, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vision and Textual Entailment</head><p>In recent years, several models have been proposed to integrate the language and vision modalities; usually the integration is operationalized by element-wise multiplication between linguistic and visual vectors. Though the interest in these modalities has spread in an astonishing way thanks to various multimodal tasks proposed, including the IC, VQA, Visual Reasoning and Visual Dialogue tasks mentioned above, very little work has been done on grounding entailment. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Young et al. (2014)</ref> has proposed the idea of considering images as the "possible worlds" on which sentences find their denotation. Hence, they released a "visual denotation graph" which associates sentences with their denotation (sets of images). The idea has been further exploited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lai and Hockenmaier (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Han et al. (2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">). Vendrov et al. (2016)</ref> look at hypernymy, textual entailment and image captioning as special cases of a single visual-semantic hierarchy over words, sentences and images, and they claim that modelling the partial order structure of this hierarchy in visual and linguistic semantic spaces improves model performance on those three tasks.</p><p>We share with this work the idea that the image can be taken as a possible world. However, we don't use sets of images to obtain the visual denotation of text in order to check whether entailment is logically valid/highly likely. Rather, we take the image to be the world/situation in which the text finds its interpretation. The only work that is close to ours is an unpublished student report <ref type="bibr">(Sitzmann et al., 2016)</ref>, which however lacks the in-depth analysis presented here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Annotated dataset of images and sentence pairs</head><p>We took as our starting point the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>, the largest natural language inference dataset available with sentence pairs labelled with entailment, contradiction and neutral relations. We augmented this dataset with images. It has been shown very recently that SNLI contains language bias, such that a simple classifier can achieve high accuracy in predicting the three classes just by having as input the hypothesis sentence. A subset of the SNLI test set with 'hard' cases, where such a simplistic classifier fails (hereafter SNLI hard ) has been released <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gururangan et al., 2018)</ref>. Hence, in this paper we will report our results on both the full dataset and the hard test set, but then zoom in on SNLI hard to understand the models' behaviour. We briefly introduce SNLI and the new test set and compare them through our annotation of linguistic phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset construction</head><p>SNLI and SNLI hard test set The SNLI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref> was built through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers were shown captions of photographs without the photo and were asked to write a new caption that (a) is definitely a true description of the photo (entailment); (b) might be a true description of the photo (neutral); (c) is definitely a false description of the photo (contradiction). Examples were provided for each of the three cases. The premises are captions which come mostly from Flickr30K <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Young et al., 2014)</ref>; only 4K captions are from VisualGenome <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Krishna et al., 2017)</ref>. In total, the dataset contains 570,152 sentence pairs, balanced with respect to the three labels. Around 10% of these data have been validated (4 annotators for each example plus the label assigned through the previous data collection phase). The development and test datasets contain 10K examples each. Moreover, each Image/Flickr caption occurs in only one of the three sets, and all the examples in the development and test sets have been validated.</p><p>V-SNLI and V-SNLI hard test set Our grounded version of SNLI, V-SNLI, has been built by matching each sentence pair in SNLI with the corresponding image coming from the Flickr30K dataset; thus the V-SNLI dataset is slightly smaller than the original, which also contains captions from VisualGenome. V-SNLI consists of <ref type="bibr">565,286 pairs (187,969 neutral, 188,453 contradiction, and 188,864 entailment)</ref>. Training, test, and development splits have been built according to the splits in SNLI. The main statistics of the splits of the dataset are reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> together with statistics for the visual counterpart of Hard SNLI, namely V-SNLI hard . By construction, V-SNLI contains datapoints such that the premise is always true with respect to the image, whereas the hypothesis can be either true (entailment or neutral cases) or false (contradiction or neutral cases.) Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Statistics of the V-SNLI dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dataset annotation</head><p>For deeper analysis and comparison of the contents of SNLI and SNLI hard , we have annotated the SNLI dataset by both automatically detecting some surface linguistic cues and manually labelling less trivial phenomena. Using an in-house annotation interface, we collected human judgments aiming to (a) filter out those cases for which the gold-standard annotation was considered to be wrong<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> ; (b) connect the three ungrounded relations to various linguistic phenomena. To achieve this, we annotated a random sample of the SNLI test set containing 527 sentence pairs (185 entailment, 171 contradiction, 171 neutral), out of which 176 were from the hard test set (56 entailment, 62 contradiction, 58 neutral).</p><p>All the pairs were annotated by at least two annotators, as follows: (a) We filtered out all the pairs which had a wrong gold label (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for details). When our annotators did not agree whether a given relation holds for a specific pair, we appealed to the corresponding five judgments coming from the validation stage of the SNLI dataset to reach a consensus based on the majority of labels. (b) We considered as valid any linguistic tag assigned by at least one annotator. Since the annotation for (a) is binary whereas for (b) it is multi-class, we used Cohen's κ for the former and also Scott's π and Krippendorff's α for the latter as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Passonneau (2006)</ref>. The inter-annotator agreement for the relation type (a) was κ = 0.93; for (b) linguistic tags it was π = 0.63, α = 0.61, and κ = 0.64<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> .  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voice</head><p>The premise is an active/passive transformation of the hypothesis.</p><p>P: Kids being walked by an adult, H: An adult is escorting some children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Swap</head><p>The sentences' subject and object are swapped from P to H. P: A woman walks in front of a giant clock, H: The clock walks in front of the woman.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref>: Tags used in manual annotation of a subset of the SNLI test set.</p><p>Linguistic phenomena Following the error analysis approach described in recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nangia et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Williams et al., 2018)</ref>, we compiled a new list of linguistic features that can be of interest when contrasting SNLI and SNLI hard , as well as for evaluating RTE models. Some of these were detected automatically, while others were assigned manually. Automatic tags included SYNONYM and ANTONYM, which were detected using WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miller, 1995)</ref>. QUANTIFIER, PRONOUN, DIFF TENSE, SUPERLATIVE and BARE NP were identified using Penn treebank labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Marcus et al., 1993)</ref>, while labels such as NEGATION were found with a straightforward keyword search. The tag LONG has been assigned to sentence pairs with a premise containing more than 30 tokens, or a hypothesis with more than 16 tokens. Details about the tags used in the manual annotation are presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We examined the differences in the tags distributions between the SNLI and SNLI hard test sets (Table 4). Interestingly, the hard sentence pairs from our random sample include proportionately more antonyms but fewer pronouns, as well as examples with different verb tenses in the premise and hypothesis, compared to the full test set. Furthermore, SNLI hard contains a significantly larger proportion of gold-standard labels which become wrong when the image is factored in (χ 2 -test with α = 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Models</head><p>In this section, we describe a variety of models that were compared on both V-SNLI and V-SNLI hard , ranging from baseline models based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bowman et al. (2015)</ref> to a state of the art model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al. (2017)</ref>. We compare the original 'blind' version of a model with a visually-augmented counterpart. In what follows, we use P and H to refer to a premise and hypothesis, respectively.</p><p>LSTM baseline (Blind) This model exploits a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory units <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref>  are then concatenated in a stack of three 512D layers having a ReLU activation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nair and Hinton, 2010)</ref>, with a final softmax layer to classify the relation between the two sentences as entailment, contradiction or neutral. The model is inspired by the LSTM baseline proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bowman et al. (2015)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> . The model exploits the 300,000 most frequent pretrained GloVe embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> and improves them during the training process. To regularize the model, Dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Srivastava et al., 2014)</ref> is applied to the inputs and outputs of the recurrent layers and to the ReLU fully connected layers with a keeping probability of 0.5. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kingma and Ba, 2014)</ref> with a learning rate of 0.001 until its accuracy on the development set drops for three successive iterations.</p><p>V-LSTM baseline The LSTM model described above is augmented with a visual component following a standard Visual Question Answering baseline model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Antol et al., 2015)</ref>. Following initial representation of P and H in 512D vectors through an LSTM, a fully-connected layer projects the L2-normalized 4096D image vector coming from the penultimate layer of a VGGnet16 Convolutional Neural Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014</ref>) to a reduced 512D vector. A fully-connected layer with a ReLU activation function is also applied to P and H to obtain two 512D vectors. The multimodal fusion between the text and the image is obtained by performing an element-wise multiplication between the vector of the text representation and the reduced vector of the image. The multimodal fusion is performed between the image and both the premise and the hypothesis, resulting in two multimodal representations. The relation between them is captured as in the model described above. This model uses GloVe embeddings and the same optimization and procedure described above.</p><p>We have also adapted a state-of-the-art attention-based model for IC and VQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Teney et al., 2017)</ref> to the GTE task. It obtains results comparable to the V-LSTM. This lack of improvement might be due to the need of further parameter tuning. We report the details of our implementation and its results in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>BiMPM The Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching (BiMPM) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2017)</ref> obtains stateof-the-art performance on the SNLI dataset, achieving a maximum accuracy of 86.9%, and going up to 88.8% in an ensemble setup. An initial embedding layer vectorises words in P and H using pretrained GLoVe embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, and passing them to a context representation layer, which uses bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) to encode context vectors for each time-step. The core part of the model is the subsequent matching layer, where each contextual embedding or time-step of P is matched against all the embeddings of H, and vice versa. The output of this layer is composed of two sequences of matching vectors, which constitute the input to another BiLSTM at the aggregation layer. The vectors from the last time-step of the BiLSTM are concatenated into a fixed-length vector, which is passed to the final prediction tier, a two-layer feed-forward network which classifies the relation between P and H  V-BiMPM model We enhanced BiMPM to account for the image, too. Our version of this model is referred to as the V-BiMPM. Here, the feature vector for an image is obtained from the layer before the fully-connected layer of a VGGnet-16. This results in a 7 × 7 × 512 tensor, which we consider as 49 512-dimensional vectors. The same matching operations are performed, except that matching occurs between P, H, and the image. Since the textual and visual vectors have different dimensionality and belong to different spaces, we first map them to a mutual space using an affine transformation. We match textual and image vectors using a cosine operation, as before. Full details of the model are reported in the Supplementary Materials for this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>The models described in the previous sections were evaluated on both (V-)SNLI and (V-)SNLI hard .</p><p>For the visually-augmented models, we experimented with configurations where image vectors were combined with both P and H (namely P+I and H+I), or only with H (P and H+I). The best setting was invariably the one where only H was grounded; hence, we focus on these results in what follows, comparing them to "blind" models. In view of recent results suggesting that biases in SNLI afford a high accuracy in the prediction task with only the hypothesis sentence as input <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gururangan et al., 2018)</ref>, we also include results for the blind models without the premise (denoted with <ref type="bibr">[H]</ref> in what follows).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the results of the various models on the full V-SNLI dataset. The same models are compared in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> on V-SNLI hard . First, note that the LSTM [H] model evinces a drop in performance compared to LSTM (from 81.49% to 68.49%), though the drop is much greater on the unbiased SNLI hard subset (from 60.99 to 25.57%). This confirms the results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gururangan et al. (2018)</ref> and justifies our additional focus on this subset of the data.</p><p>The effect of grounding in these models is less clear. The LSTM baseline performs worse when it is visually augmented; this is the case of V-SNLI and, even more drastically, V-SNLI hard . It is also true irrespective of the relationship type. On the other hand, the V-BiMPM model improves marginally across the board, compared to BiMPM, on the V-SNLI data. On the hard subset, the images appear to hurt performance somewhat in the case of contradiction (from 77.62% to 76.12%), but improve it by a substantial margin on neutral cases (from 59.36% to 63.67%). The neutral case is the hardest for all models, with the possible exception of LSTM [H] on the full dataset.</p><p>Overall, the results suggest that factoring in images either hinders performance (as in the case of the V-LSTM baseline), or helps only marginally (as in the case of V-BiMPM). In the latter case, we also observe instances where factoring in images hurts performance. In an effort to understand the results, we turn to a more detailed error analysis of the V-BiMPM model, first in relation to the dataset annotations, and then by zooming in somewhat closer on V-SNLI hard .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Error analysis by linguistic annotation label</head><p>In Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, accuracies for the blind and grounded version of BiMPM are broken down by the labels given to the sentence pairs in the annotated subset of SNLI described in Section 3. We only observe a significant difference in the Entity case, that is, where the referents in P and H are inconsistent. Here, the blind model outperforms the grounded one, an unexpected result, since one would assume a grounded model to be better equipped to identify mismatched referents. Hence, in the following we aim to understand whether the models properly deal with the grounding sub-task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Error analysis on grounding in the SNLI hard</head><p>We next turn to the "hard" subset of the data, where V-BiMPM showed some improvement over the blind case, but suffered on contradiction cases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). We analysed the 207 cases in SNLI hard where the V-BiMPM made incorrect predictions compared to the blind model, that is, where the image hurt performance. These were annotated independently by two of the authors (raw inter-annotator agreement: 96%) who (a) read the two sentences, P and H; (b) checked whether the relation annotated in the dataset actually held or whether it was an annotation error; (c) in those cases where it held, checked whether including the image actually resulted in a change in the relation.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> displays the proportions of image mismatch and incorrect annotations. As the table suggests, in the cases where images hinder performance in the V-BiMPM, it is usually because the image changes the relation (thus, these are cases of image mismatch; see Section 1 for an example); this occurs in a large proportion of cases labelled as neutral in the dataset.</p><p>Inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mironenco et al., 2017)</ref>, we further explored the impact of visual grounding in both the V-LSTM and V-BiMPM by comparing their performance on SNLI hard , with the same subset incorporating image "foils". Vectors for the images in the V-SNLI test set were compared pairwise using cosine, and for each test case in V-SNLI hard , the actual image was replaced with the most dissimilar image in the full test set. The rationale is that, if visual grounding is really helpful in recognising the semantic relationship between P and H, we should observe a drop in performance when the images are  unrelated to the scenario described by the sentences. The results are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>, which also reproduces the original results on V-SNLI hard from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> for ease of reference.</p><p>As the results show, models are not hurt by the foil image, contrary to our expectations. V-BiMPM overall drops just by 0.67% whereas V-LSTM drop is somewhat higher (-2.11%) showing it might be doing a better job on the grounding sub-task.</p><p>As a final check, we sought to isolate the grounding from the reasoning sub-task, focusing only on the former. We compared the models when grounding only the hypothesis [H+I], while leaving out the premise. Note that this test is different from the evaluation of the model using only the hypothesis [H]: Whereas in that case the input is not expected to provide any useful information to perform the task, here it is. As we noted in Section 3, by construction the premise is always true with respect to the image while the hypothesis can be either true (entailment or neutral cases) or false (contradiction or neutral cases). A model that is grounding the text adequately would be expected to confuse both entailment and contradiction cases with neutral ones; on the other hand, neutral cases should be confused with entailments or contradictions. Confusing contradictions with entailments would be a sign that a model is grounding inadequately, since it is not recognising that H is false with respect to the image.</p><p>As the left panel of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref> shows, V-BiMPM outperforms V-LSTM by a substantial margin, though the performance of both models drops substantially with this setup. The right panel in the table shows that neither model is free of implausible errors (confusing entailments and contradictions), though V-BiMPM makes substantially fewer of these.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This paper has investigated the potential of grounding the textual entailment task in visual data. We argued that a Grounded Textual Entailment model needs to perform two tasks: (a) the grounding itself, and (b) reasoning about the relation between the sentences, against the visual information. Our results suggest that a model based on matching and aggregation like the BiMPM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2017)</ref> can perform very well at the reasoning task, classifying entailment relations correctly much more frequently than a baseline V-LSTM. On the other hand, it is not clear that grounding is being performed adequately in this model. It is primarily in the case of contradictions that the image seems to play a direct role in biasing the classification towards the right or wrong class, depending on whether the image is correct.</p><p>In summary, two conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, in those cases where the inclusion of visual information results in a loss of accuracy, this is often due to the image resulting in a change in the original relation annotated in the dataset. A related observation is that using foil images results in a greater drop in performance on contradiction cases, possibly because in such cases, grounding serves to identify a mismatch between the hypothesis and the scene described by the premise, a situation which is rendered opaque by the introduction of foils. Second, in those cases where improvements are observed in the state of the art V-BiMPM, the precise role played by the image is not straightforward. Indeed, we find that this model still marginally outperforms the 'blind', text-only model overall, when the images involved are foils rather than actual images.</p><p>We believe that further research on grounded TE is worthy of the NLP community's attention. While linking language with perception is currently a topical issue, there has been relatively little work on linking grounding directly with inference. By drawing closer to a joint solution to the grounding and inference tasks, models will also be better able to address language understanding in the real world.</p><p>The present paper presented a first step in this direction using a version of an existing TE dataset which was augmented with images that could be paired directly with the premises, since these were originally captions for those images. However, it is important to note that in this dataset premise-hypotheses pairs were not generated directly with reference to the images themselves. An important issue to consider in future work on GTE, besides the development of better models, is the development of datasets in which the role of perceptual information is controlled, ensuring that the data on which models are trained represents truly grounded inferences.  Here, we report some further details of our implementation of the V-BiMPM model described in Section 4 of the main paper, based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al. (2017)</ref>. Our model is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The core part of the original BiMPM is the matching layer. Given two d-dimensional vectors v P and v H , each replicated l times (l is the number of 'perspectives') and a trainable l × d weight matrix W , matching involves a cosine similarity computation that yields an l-dimensional matching vector m, whose elements are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m k = cosine (W k • v P , W k • v H )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The matching operations included are the following:</p><p>1. full-matching, where each forward or backward contextual embedding of the premise P (resp. the hypothesis H) is matched to the last time-step of H (resp. P);</p><p>2. max-pooling, where each forward/backward contextual embedding of one sentence is compared to the embeddings of the other, retaining the maximum value for each dimension;</p><p>3. attentive matching, where first, the pairwise cosine similarity between forward/backward embeddings of P and H is estimated, before calculating an attentive vector over the weighted sum of contextual embeddings for H and matching each forward/backward embedding of P against the attentive vector;</p><p>4. max-attentive matching, a version of attentive matching where the contextual embedding with the highest cosine is used as the attentive vector, instead of the weighted sum.</p><p>The visually-augmented version of the original model, V-BiMPM, is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. To perform multimodal matching, the visual and textual vectors are mapped to a mutual space using the following affine transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v i = W t f i + b t ; f i ∈ R e ; W t ∈ R e×d ; b t , v i ∈ R d (2)</formula><p>where W t , b t , f i , and v i are the weight matrix, the bias, the input features and output features, respectively, and t is any text (P or H). Given weight matrices W ∈ R l×d for text and U l×d for images, we compute the matching vector m between a textual vector v t and image vector v i as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m k = cosine (W k • v t , U k • v i )<label>(3)</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Premise, Hypothesis and Image examples</figDesc><graphic coords="2,105.30,62.81,137.50,91.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>

A top-down attention mechanism is used between the premise (resp. hypothesis) and each of the L2-normalized 2048D image vectors corresponding to the region proposals to obtain an attention score for each of them. Then, a 2048D image vector encoding the most interesting visual features for the premise (hypothesis) is obtained as a sum of the 36 image vectors weighted by the corresponding attention scores for the premise (hypothesis). A fully-connected layer with a gated tanh activation function is applied to the image vector of the most interesting visual features for the premise and for the hypothesis to obtain a reduced 512D vector for each of them. A fully-connected layer with a gated tanh activation function is also applied to the premise and to the hypothesis in order to obtain a reduced 512D vector for each of them.</p><p>The multimodal fusion between the premise (hypothesis) and the image vector of the most interesting visual features for the premise (hypothesis) is obtained by performing an element-wise multiplication between the reduced vector of the premise (hypothesis) and the reduced vector of the most interesting visual features for the premise (hypothesis). After that, the model feeds the concatenation of the two resulting multimodal representations to a stack of three 512D layers having a gated tanh activation function, with a final softmax layer to classify the relation between the two sentences as entailment, contradiction or neutral. This model uses GloVe embeddings and the same optimization tricks and procedure of the LSTM and V-LSTM models.</p><p>We report the accuracies of the VQA models against the various tests reported in the paper.
