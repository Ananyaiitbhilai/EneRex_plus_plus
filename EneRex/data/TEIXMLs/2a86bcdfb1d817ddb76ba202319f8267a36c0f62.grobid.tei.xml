<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD), using only image-level annotations to train object detectors, is of growing importance in object recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for WSOD. Unlike previous networks that transfer the object detection problem to an image classification problem using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), our strategy generates proposal clusters to learn refined instance classifiers by an iterative process. The proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent and associated with the same object. This prevents the network from concentrating too much on parts of objects instead of whole objects. We first show that instances can be assigned object or background labels directly based on proposal clusters for instance classifier refinement, and then show that treating each cluster as a small new bag yields fewer ambiguities than the directly assigning label method. The iterative instance classifier refinement is implemented online using multiple streams in convolutional neural networks, where the first is an MIL network and the others are for instance classifier refinement supervised by the preceding one. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and MS-COCO benchmarks for WSOD. Results show that our method outperforms the previous state of the art significantly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>O BJECT detection is one of the most important problems in computer vision with many applications. Recently, due to the development of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [1], <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[2]</ref> and the availability of large scale datasets with detailed boundingbox-level annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[5]</ref>, there have been great leap forwards in object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[11]</ref>. However, it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to collect detailed annotations, whereas acquiring images with only image-level annotations (i.e., image tags) indicating whether an object class exists in an image or not is much easier. For example, we can use image search queries to search on the Internet (e.g., Google and Flickr) to obtain a mass of images with such image-level annotations. This fact inspires us to explore methods for the Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) problem, i.e., training object detectors with only image tag supervisions.</p><p>Many previous methods follow the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline for WSOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>. They treat images as bags and proposals as instances; then instance classifiers (object detectors) are trained under MIL constraints (i.e., a positive bag contains at least one positive instance and all instances in negative bags are negative). In addition, inspired by the great success of CNN, recent efforts often combine MIL and CNN to obtain better WSOD performance. Some researches have shown that treating CNNs pre-trained on large scale datasets as offthe-shelf proposal feature extractors can obtain much better performance than traditional hand-designed features <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[15]</ref>. Moreover, many recent works have achieved even better results for WSOD by an MIL network using standard end-to-end training <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref> or a variant of endto-end training <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>. See Section 2.3 for this variant of end-to-end and how it differs from the standard one. We use the same strategy of training a variant of end-to-end MIL network inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Although some promising results have been obtained by MIL networks for WSOD, they do not perform as well as fully supervised ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[8]</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (a)</ref>, previous MIL networks integrate the MIL constraints into the network training by transferring the instance classification (object detection) problem to a bag classification (image classification) problem, where the final image scores are the aggregation of the proposal scores. However, there is a big gap between image classification and object detection. For classification, even parts of objects can contribute to correct results (e.g., the red boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), because important parts include many characteristics of the objects. Many proposals only cover parts of objects, and "seeing" proposals only of parts may be enough to roughly localize the objects. But this may not localize objects well enough considering the performance requirement of high Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between the resulting boxes and groundtruth bound-  ingboxes: the top ranking proposals may only localize parts of objects instead of whole objects. Recall that for detection, the resulting boxes should not only give correct classification, but also localize objects and have enough overlap with groundtruth boundingboxes (e.g., the green boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Before presenting our solution of the problem referred above, we first introduce the concept of proposal cluster. Object detection requires algorithms to generate multiple overlapping proposals closely surrounding objects to ensure high proposal recall (e.g., for each object, there are tens of proposals on average from Selective Search <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[20]</ref> which have IoU&gt;0.5 with the groundtruth boundingbox on the PASCAL VOC dataset). Object proposals in an image can be grouped into different spatial clusters. Except for one cluster for background proposals, each object cluster is associated with a single object and proposals in each cluster are spatially adjacent, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For fully supervised object detection (i.e., training object detectors using boundingboxlevel annotations), proposal clusters can be generated by treating the groundtruth boundingboxes as cluster centers. Then object detectors are trained according to the proposal clusters (e.g., assigning all proposals the label of the corresponding object class for each cluster). This alleviates the problem that detectors may only focus on parts.</p><p>But in the weakly supervised scenario, it is difficult to generate proposal clusters because groundtruth boundingboxes that can be used as cluster centers are not provided. To cope with this difficulty, we suggest to find proposal clusters as follows. First we generate proposal cluster centers from those proposals which have high classification scores during training, because these top ranking proposals can always detect at least parts of objects. That is, for each image, after obtaining proposal scores, we select some proposals with high scores as cluster centers, and then proposal clusters are generated based on spatial overlaps with the cluster centers. Then the problem reduces to how to select proposals as centers, because many high scoring proposals may correspond to the same object. The most straightforward way is to  We propose to treat each proposal cluster as a small new bag. "0", "1", and "2" indicate the "background", "motorbike", and "car", respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{ 𝑋, 1, 2 } Object Detector (a) 𝑋 { 𝑥 1 , 0 , 𝑥 2 , 0 … 𝑥 4 , 1 , 𝑥</formula><p>choose the proposal with the highest score for each positive object class (i.e., the object class exists in the image) as the center. But such a method ignores the fact that there may exist more than one object with the same object category in natural images (e.g., the two motorbikes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Therefore, we propose a graph-based method to find cluster centers. More specifically, we build a graph of top ranking proposals according to the spatial similarity for each positive object class. In the graph, two proposals are connected if they have enough spatial overlaps. Then we greedily and iteratively choose the proposals which have most connections with others to estimate the centers. Although a cluster center proposal may only capture an object partially, its adjacent proposals (i.e., other proposals in the cluster) can cover the whole object, or at worst contain larger parts of the object.</p><p>Based on these proposal clusters, we propose two methods to refine instance classifiers (object detectors) during training. We first propose to assign proposals object labels directly. That is, for each cluster, we assign its proposals the label of its corresponding object class, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (b)</ref>. Compared with the conventional MIL network in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a), this strategy forces network to "see" larger parts of objects by assigning object labels to proposals that cover larger parts of objects directly, which fills the gap between classification and detection to some extent. While effective, this strategy still has potential ambiguities, because assigning the same object label to proposals that cover different parts of objects simultaneously may confuse the network and will hurt the discriminative power of the detector. To address this problem, we propose to treat each proposal cluster as a small new bag to train refined instance classifiers, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (c</ref>). Most of the proposals in these new bags should have relatively high classification scores because the cluster centers covers at least parts of objects and proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent (except for the background cluster). In the same time, not all proposals in the bags should have high classification scores. Thus compared with the directly assigning label strategy, this strategy is more flexible and can reduce the ambiguities to some extent. We name our method Proposal Cluster Learning (PCL) because it learns refined instance classifiers based on proposal clusters.</p><p>To implement our idea effectively and efficiently, we further propose an online training approach. Our network has multiple output streams as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The first stream is a basic MIL network which aggregates proposal scores into final image scores to train basic instance classifiers, and the other streams refine the instance classifiers iteratively. During the forward process of training, proposal classification scores are obtained and proposal clusters are generated consequently for each stream. Then based on these proposal clusters, supervisions are generated to compute losses for the next stream. According to the losses, these refined classifiers are trained during back-propagation. Except for the first stream that is supervised by image labels, the other streams are supervised by the image labels as well as outputs from their preceding streams. As our method forces the network to "see" larger parts of objects, the detector can discover the whole object instead of parts gradually by performing refinement multiple times (i.e., multiple output streams). But at the start of training, all classifiers are almost untrained, which will result in very noisy proposal clusters, and so the training will deviate from the correct solutions a lot. Thus we design a weighted loss further by associating different proposals with different weights in different training iterations. After that, all training procedures can thus be integrated into a single end-to-end network. This can improve the performance benefiting from our PCL-based classifier refinement procedure. It is also very computational efficient in both training and testing. In addition, performance can be improved by sharing proposal features among different output streams.</p><p>We elaborately conduct many experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and MS-COCO datasets to confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our method achieves 48.8% mAP and 66.6% CorLoc on VOC 2007 which is more than 5% absolute improvement compared with previous best performed methods.</p><p>This paper is an extended version of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref>. In particular, we give more analyses of our method and enrich literatures of most recent related works, making the manuscript more complete. In addition, we make two methodological improvements: the first one is to generate proposal clusters using graphs of top ranking proposals instead of using the highest scoring proposal, and the second one is to treat each proposal cluster as a small new bag. In addition, we provide more discussions of experimental results, and show the effectiveness of our method on the challenging ImageNet detection and MS-COCO datasets.</p><p>The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some related works are introduced. In Section 3, the details of our method are described. Elaborate experiments and analyses are conducted in Section 4. Finally, conclusions and future directions are presented in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multiple instance learning</head><p>MIL, first proposed for drug activity prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[22]</ref>, is a classical weakly supervised learning problem. Many variants have been proposed for MIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[25]</ref>. In MIL, a set of bags are given, and each bag is associated with a collection of instances. It is natural to treat WSOD as an MIL problem. Then the problem turns into finding instance classifiers only given bag labels. Our method also follows the MIL strategy and makes several improvements to WSOD. In particular, we learn refined instance classifiers based on proposal clusters according to both instance scores and spatial relations in an online manner. 1  MIL has many applications to computer vision, such as image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, weakly supervised semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[29]</ref>, object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref>, object tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[31]</ref>, etc. The strategy of treating proposal clusters as bags was partly inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[31]</ref>, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref> proposes to train MIL for patches around groundtruth locations and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[31]</ref> proposes to train MIL for patches around predicted object locations. However, they require groundtruth locations for either all training samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref> or the beginning time frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[31]</ref>, whereas WSOD does not have such annotations. Therefore, it is much harder to generate proposal clusters only guided by image-level supervisions for WSOD. In addition, we incorporate the strategy of treating proposal clusters as bags into the network training whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[31]</ref> do not. Oquab et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[32]</ref> also train a CNN network using the max pooing MIL strategy to localize objects. But their methods can only coarsely localize objects regardless of their sizes and aspect ratios, whereas our method can detect objects more accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Weakly supervised object detection</head><p>WSOD has attracted great interests nowadays because the amount of data with image-level annotations is much bigger and is growing much faster than that with boundingboxlevel annotations. Many methods are emerging for the WSOD problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[40]</ref>. For example, Chum and Zisserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[33]</ref> first initialize object locations by discriminative visual words and then introduce an exemplar model to measure similarity between image pairs for updating locations. Deselaers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[34]</ref> propose to initialize boxes by objectness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[41]</ref> and use a CRF-based model to iteratively localize objects. Pandey and Lazebnik <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[35]</ref> train a DPM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[42]</ref> under weak supervisions for WSOD. Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[36]</ref> use Bayesian latent topic models to jointly model different object classes and background. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[38]</ref> develop a technology to discover frequent discriminative configurations of visual patterns for robust WSOD. Cinbis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[13]</ref> iteratively train a multi-fold MIL to avoid the detector being locked onto inaccurate local optima. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref> relax the MIL constraints into a derivable loss function to train detectors more efficient.</p><p>Recently, with the revolution of CNNs in computer vision, many works also try to combine the WSOD with CNNs. Early works treat CNN models pre-trained on Im-ageNet as off-the-shelf feature extractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[40]</ref>. They extract CNN features for each candidate regions, and then train their own detectors on top of these features. These methods have shown that CNN descriptors can boost performance against traditional hand-designed features. More recent efforts tend to train end-to-end networks for WSOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>. They integrate the MIL constraints into the network training by aggregating proposal classification scores into final image classification scores, and then image-level supervision can be directly added to image classification scores. For example, Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref> propose to use max pooling for aggregation. Bilen and Vedaldi <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> develop a weighted sum pooing 1. "Instance" and "proposal" are used interchangeably in this paper.</p><p>strategy. Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, Kantorov et al. argue that context information can improve the performance. Diba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref> show that weakly supervised segmentation map can be used as guidance to filter proposals, and jointly train the weakly supervised segmentation network and WSOD end-to-end. Our method is built on these networks and any of them can be chosen as our basic network. Our strategy proposes to learn refined instance classifiers based on proposal clusters, and propose a novel online approach to train our network effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show our strategies can boost the results significantly.</p><p>In addition to the weighted sum pooing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> also proposes a "spatial regulariser" that forces features of the highest scoring proposal and its spatially adjacent proposals to be the same. Unlike this, we show that finding proposal cluster centers using graph and treating proposal clusters as bags are more effective. The contemporary work <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref> uses a graph model to generate seed proposals. Their network training has many steps: first, an MIL network <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref> is trained; second, seed proposals are generated using the graph; third, based on these seed proposals, a Fast R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref> like detector is trained. Our method differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref> in many aspects: first, we propose to generate proposal clusters for each training iteration and thus our network is trained end-to-end instead of step-by-step, which is more efficient and can benefit from sharing proposal features among different streams; second, we propose to treat proposal clusters as bags for training better classifiers. As evidenced by experiments, our method obtains much better and more robust results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">End-to-end and its variants</head><p>In standard end-to-end training, the update requires optimizing losses w.r.t. all functions of network parameters. For example, the Fast R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref> optimizes their classification loss and boundingbox regression loss w.r.t. proposal classification and feature extraction for fully supervised object detection. The MIL networks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref> optimize their MIL loss w.r.t. proposal classification and feature extraction for WSOD.</p><p>Unlike the standard end-to-end training, there exists a variant of end-to-end training. The variant contains functions which depend on network parameters, but losses are not optimized w.r.t. all these functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>. As we described in Section 2.2, the "spatial regulariser" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> forces features of the highest scoring proposal and its spatially adjacent proposals to be the same. They use a function of network parameters to compute the highest scoring proposal, and do not optimize their losses w.r.t. this function. Diba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref> filter out background proposals using a function of network parameters and use these filtered proposals in their latter network computations. They also do not optimize their losses w.r.t. this function. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>, we use this variant of end-to-end training. More precisely, we do not optimize our losses w.r.t. the generated supervisions for instance classifier refinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Others</head><p>There are many other important related works that do not focus on weakly supervised learning but should be discussed. Similar to other end-to-end MIL networks, our method is built on top of the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref> or Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref> to share convolutional computations among different proposals for model acceleration. But both <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref> require boundingbox-level annotations to train their detectors. The sharing proposal feature strategy in our network is similar to multi-task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[46]</ref>. Unlike the multi-task learning that each output stream has their own relatively independent external supervisions for different tasks, in our method, all streams have the same task and supervisions of later streams depend on the outputs from their preceding streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD</head><p>The overall architecture of our method is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Given an image, about 2, 000 object proposals from Selective Search <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[20]</ref> or EdgeBox <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[47]</ref> are generated. During the forward process of training, the image and these proposals are fed into some convolutional (conv) layers with an SPP layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref> to produce a fixed-size conv feature map per-proposal. After that, proposal feature maps are fed into two fully connected (fc) layers to produce proposal features. These features are branched into different streams: the first one is an MIL network to train basic instance classifiers and the others refine the classifiers iteratively. For each stream, proposal classification scores are obtained and proposal clusters are generated consequently. Then based on these proposal clusters, supervisions are generated to compute losses for the next stream. During the back-propagation process of training, the network losses are optimized to train proposal features and classifiers. As shown in the figure, supervisions of the 1-st refined classifier depend on the output from the basic classifier, and supervisions of k-th refined classifier depend on outputs from {k -1}-th refined classifier. In this section, we will introduce our method of learning refined instance classifiers based on proposal clusters in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notations</head><p>Before presenting our method, we first introduce some of the mostly used notations as follows. We have R proposals with boxes B = {b r } R r=1 for an given image and proposal features F, where b r is the r-th proposal box. The number of refined instance classifiers is K (i.e., we refine instance classifier K times), and thus there are K + 1 streams. The number of object classes is C. W 0 and W k , k ∈ {1, ..., K} are the parameters of the basic instance classifier and the k-th refined instance classifier, respectively. ϕ 0 (F, W 0 ) ∈ R C×R and ϕ k (F, W k ) ∈ R (C+1)×R , k ∈ {1, ..., K} are the predicted score matrices of the basic instance classifier and the k-th refined instance classifier, respectively, where C + 1 indicates the C object classes and 1 background class. We use ϕ k later for simplification, dropping the dependence on F, W k . ϕ k cr is the predicted score of the r-th proposal for class c from the k-th instance classifier. y = [y 1 , ..., y C ] T is the image label vector, where y c = 1 or 0 indicates the image with or without object class c.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Basic MIL network</head><p>It is necessary to generate proposal scores and clusters to supervise refined instance classifiers. More specifically, the first refined classifier requires basic instance classifiers to generate proposal scores and clusters. Therefore, we first introduce our basic MIL network as the basic instance classifier. Our overall network is independent of the specific MIL methods, and thus any method that can be trained endto-end could be used. There are many possible choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>. Here we choose the method by Bilen and Vedaldi <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> which proposes a weighted sum pooling strategy to obtain the instance classifier, because of its effectiveness and implementation convenience. To make our paper selfcontained, we briefly introduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> as follows.</p><p>Given an input image and its proposal boxes B = {b r } R r=1 , a set of proposal features F are first generated by the network. Then as shown in the "Basic MIL network" block of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, there are two branches which process the proposal features to produce two matrices X cls (F, W cls ), X det (F, W det ) ∈ R C×R (we use X cls , X det later for simplification, dropping the dependence on F, W cls , W det ) of an input image by two fc layers, where W cls and W det denote the parameters of the fc layer for X cls and the parameters of the fc layer for X det , respectively. Then the two matrices are passed through two softmax layer along different directions: [σ(X cls )] cr = e x cls cr / C c =1 e x cls c r and [σ(X det )] cr = e x det cr / R r =1 e x det cr . Let us denote (W cls , W det ) by W 0 . The proposal scores are generated by element-wise product ϕ 0 (F, W 0 ) = σ(X cls ) σ(X det ). Finally, the image score of the c-th class [φ(F, W 0 )] c is obtained by the sum over all proposals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">[φ(F, W 0 )] c = R r=1 [ϕ 0 (F, W 0 )] cr .</formula><p>A simple interpretation of the two branches framework is as follows. [σ(X cls )] cr is the probability of the r-th proposal belonging to class c. [σ(X det )] cr is the normalized weight that indicates the contribution of the r-th proposal to image being classified to class i. So [φ(F, W 0 )] c is obtained by weighted sum pooling and falls in the range of (0, 1). Given the image label vector y = [y 1 , ..., y C ] T .

We integrate the basic MIL network and the classifier refinement into an end-to-end network to learn the refined classifier online. Unlike the basic instance classifier, for an input image the output score matrix ϕ k (F, W k ) of the k-th refined classifier is a {C + 1} × R matrix and is obtained by passing the proposal features through a single fc layer (with parameters W k ) as well as a softmax over-classes layer, i.e., ϕ k (F, W k ) ∈ R (C+1)×R , k ∈ {1, 2, ..., K}, as in the "Instance classifier refinement" blocks of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.

We summarize this procedure in Algorithm 1. Note that we do not use an alternating training strategy, i.e., fixing supervisions and training a complete model, fixing the model and updating supervisions. The reasons are that: 1) it is very time-consuming because it requires training models multiple times; 2) training different models in different refinement steps separately may harm the performance because it hinders the process to benefit from the shared proposal features (i.e., F).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Proposal cluster learning</head><p>Here we will introduce our methods to learn refined instance classifiers based on proposal clusters (i.e., proposal cluster learning).</p><p>Recall from Section 3.1 that we have a set of proposals with boxes B = {b r } R r=1 . For the k-th refinement, our goal is to generate supervisions H k (ϕ k-1 , y) for the loss functions L k F, W k , H k (ϕ k-1 , y) using the proposal scores ϕ k-1 and image label y in each training iteration. We use H k , L k later for simplification, dropping the dependence on ϕ k-1 , y, F, W k .</p><p>We do this in three steps. 1) We find proposal cluster centers which are proposals corresponding to different objects. 2) We group the remaining proposals into different clusters, where each cluster is associated with a cluster center or corresponds to the background. 3) We generate the supervisions H k for the loss functions L k , enabling us to train the refined instance classifiers.</p><p>For the first step, we compute proposal cluster centers S k = {S k n } N k n=1 based on ϕ k-1 and y. The n-th cluster center</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">S k n = (b k n , y k n , s k n )</formula><p>is defined in Section 3.1. We propose two algorithms to find S k in Section 3.4.1 (1) and (2) (also Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3), where the first one was proposed in the conference version paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref> and the second one is proposed in this paper.</p><p>For the second step, according to the proposal cluster centers S k , proposal clusters</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C k = {C k n } N k +1 n=1 are generated (C k N k +1</formula><p>for background and others for objects).

We use the different notation for the background cluster because background proposals are scattered in each image, and thus it is hard to determine a cluster center and accordingly a cluster score. The method to generate C k was proposed in the conference version paper and is described in Section 3.4.2 (also Algorithm 4).</p><p>For the third step, supervisions H k to train the k-th refined instance classifier are generated based on the proposal clusters. We use two strategies where H k are either proposal-level labels indicating whether a proposal belongs to an object class, or cluster-level labels that treats each proposal cluster as a bag. Subsequently these are used to compute the loss functions L k . We propose two approaches to do this as described in Section 3.4.3 (1) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref>, where the first one was proposed in the conference version paper and the second one is proposed in this paper.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Finding proposal cluster centers</head><p>In the following we introduce two algorithms to find proposal cluster centers.</p><p>(1) Finding proposal cluster centers using the highest scoring proposal. A solution for finding proposal cluster centers is to choose the highest scoring proposal, as in our conference version paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref>. As in Algorithm 2, suppose an image has object class label c (i.e., y c = 1). For the k-th refinement, we first select the r k c -th proposal which has the highest score by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">3</ref>), where ϕ k-1 cr is the predicted score of the r-th proposal, as defined in Section 3.1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">r k c = argmax r ϕ k-1 cr .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Then this proposal is chosen as the cluster center, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S k n = (b k n , y k n , s k n ) = (b r k c , c, ϕ k-1 cr k c</formula><p>), where b r k c is the box of the r k c -th proposal. ϕ k-1 cr is chosen as the confidence score that the r-th proposal covers at least part of an object of class c, because ϕ k-1 cr is the predicted score of the r-th proposal been categorized to class c. Therefore, the highest scoring proposal can probably cover at least part of the object and thus be chosen as the cluster center.</p><p>There is a potential problem that one proposal may be chosen as the cluster centers for multiple object classes. To avoid this problem, if one proposal corresponds to the cluster centers for multiple object classes, this proposal would be chosen as the cluster center only by the class with the highest predicted score and we re-choose cluster centers for other classes.</p><p>(2) Finding proposal cluster centers using graphs of top ranking proposals. As stated in Section 1, although we can find good proposal cluster centers using the highest scoring proposal, this ignores that in natural images there are often more than one object for each category. Therefore, we propose a new method to find cluster centers using graphs of top ranking proposals.</p><p>More specifically, suppose an image has object class label c. We first select the top ranking proposals with indexes</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">R k c = {r k c1 , ..., r k cN k c</formula><p>} for the k-th refinement.

After that, we greedily generate some cluster centers for class c using this graph. That is, we iteratively select vertexes which have most connections to be the cluster centers, as in Algorithm 3. The number of cluster centers (i.e., N k ) changes for each image in each training iteration because the top ranking proposals R k c change. See Section 4.2.9 for some typical values of N k . We use the same method as in Section 3.4.1 (1) to avoid one proposal been chosen as the cluster centers for multiple object classes.</p><p>The reasons for this strategy are as follows. First, according to our observation, the top ranking proposals can always cover at least parts of objects, thus generating centers from these proposals encourages the selected centers to meet our requirements. Second, because these proposals cover objects well, better proposals (covering more parts of objects) should have more spatially overlapped proposals (i.e., have more connections). Third, these centers are spatially far apart, and thus different centers can correspond to different objects. This method also has the attractive characteristic that it can generate adaptive number of proposals for each object class, which is desirable because in natural images there are arbitrary number of objects per-class. We set the score of the n-th proposal cluster center s k n by s k n = max There is an important issue for the graph-based method: how to select the top ranking proposals? A simple method is to select proposals whose scores exceed a threshold. But in our case, proposal scores change in each training iteration, and thus it is hard to determine a threshold. Instead, for each Algorithm 4 Generating proposal clusters</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Input: Proposal boxes B = {b 1 , ..., b R }; proposal cluster centers S k = {S k 1 , ..., S k N k }.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Generating proposal clusters</head><p>After the cluster centers are found, we generate the proposal clusters as in our conference version paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref>. Except for the cluster for background, good proposal clusters require that proposals in the same cluster are associated with the same object, and thus proposals in the same cluster should be spatially adjacent. Specially, given the r-th proposal, we compute a set of IoUs {I k r1 , ..., I k rN k where I k rn is the IoU between the r-th proposal and the box b k n of the n-th cluster center. Then we assign the r-th proposal to the n k r -th object cluster if I k rn k r is larger than a threshold I t (e.g., 0.5) and to the background cluster otherwise, where n k r is the index of the most spatially adjacent cluster center as Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(5)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">n k r = argmax n I k rn .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The overall procedures to generate proposal clusters are summarized in Algorithm 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Learning refined instance classifiers</head><p>To get supervisions H k and loss functions L k to learn the k-th refined instance classifier, we design two approaches as follows.</p><p>(1) Assigning proposals object labels. The most straightforward way to refine classifiers is to directly assign object labels to all proposals in object clusters because these proposals potentially correspond to whole objects, as in our conference version paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref>. As the cluster centers covers at least parts of objects, their adjacent proposals (i.e., proposals in the cluster) can contain larger parts of objects. Accordingly, we can assign the cluster label y k n to all proposals in the n-th cluster.</p><p>More specifically, the supervisions H k are proposal-level labels, i.e., H k = {y k r } R r=1 . y k r = [y k 1r , ..., y k (C+1)r ] T ∈ R (C+1)×1 is the label vector of the r-th proposal for the kth refinement, where y k y k n r = 1 and y k cr = 0, c = y k n if the r-th proposal belongs to the n-th clusters. Consequently, we use the standard softmax loss function to train the refined classifiers as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">6</ref>), where ϕ k cr is the predicted score of the r-th proposal as defined in Section 3.1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">L k F, W k , H k = - 1 R R r=1 C+1 c=1 y k cr log ϕ k cr .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Through iterative instance classifier refinement (i.e., multiple times of refinement as k increase), the detector detects larger parts of objects gradually by forcing the network to "see" larger parts of objects.</p><p>Actually, the so learnt supervisions H k are very noisy, especially in the beginning of training. This results in unstable solutions. To solve this problem, we change the loss in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">6</ref>) to a weighted version, as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">7</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">L k F, W k , H k = - 1 R R r=1 C+1 c=1 λ k r y k cr log ϕ k cr .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>λ k r is the loss weight that is the same as the cluster confidence score s k n for object clusters or proposal confidence score s k nm for the background cluster if the r-th proposal belongs to the n-th cluster. From Algorithm 4, we can observe that λ k r is the same as the cluster center confidence score s k n . The reasons for this strategy are as follows. In the beginning of training, although we cannot obtain good proposal clusters, each s k n is small, hence each λ k r is small and the loss is also small. As a consequence, the performance of the network will not decrease a lot. During the training, the top ranking proposals will cover objects well, and thus we can generate good proposal clusters. Then we can train satisfactory instance classifiers.</p><p>(2) Treating clusters as bags. As we stressed before, although directly assigning proposals object labels can boost the results, it may confuse the network because we simultaneously assign the same label to different parts of objects. Focusing on this, we further propose to treat each proposal cluster as a small new bag and use the cluster label as the bag label. Thus the supervisions H k for the k-th refinement are bag-level (cluster-level) labels, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">H k = {y k n } N k +1 n=1 . y k n</formula><p>is the label of the n-th bag, i.e., the label of the n-th proposal cluster, as defined in Section 3.1.</p><p>Specially, for object clusters, we choose average MIL pooling, because these proposals should cover at least parts of objects and thus should have relatively high prediction scores. For the background cluster, we assign the background label to all proposals in the cluster according to the MIL constraints (all instances in negative bags are negative).</p><p>Then the loss function for refinement will be Eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">L k F, W k , H k = - 1 R ( N k n=1 s k n M k n log r s.t. br∈B k n ϕ k y k n r M k n + r∈C k N k +1 λ k r log ϕ k (C+1)r ). (8) s k n , M k</formula><p>n , and ϕ k cr are the cluster confidence score of the n-th object cluster, the number of proposals in the n-th cluster, and the predicted score of the r-th proposal, respectively, as defined in Section 3.1. b r ∈ B k n and r ∈ C k N k +1 indicate that the r-th proposal belongs to the n-th object cluster and the background cluster respectively.</p><p>Compared with the directly assigning label approach, this method tolerates some proposals to have low scores, which can reduce the ambiguities to some extent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Implementation details</head><p>Our method is built on two pre-trained ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[4]</ref> networks VGG M <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[49]</ref> and VGG16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[50]</ref>, each of which has some conv layers with max-pooling layers and three fc layers. We replace the last max-pooling layer by the SPP layer, and the last fc layer as well as the softmax loss layer by the layers described in Section 3. To increase the feature map size from the last conv layer, we replace the penultimate max-pooling layer and its subsequent conv layers by the dilated conv layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[52]</ref>. The newly added layers are initialized using Gaussian distributions with 0-mean and standard deviations 0.01.

Then we decrease the learning rate to 0.0001 in the following 10K, 20K, 5K, and 20K iterations for the PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets, respectively. The momentum and weight decay are set to be 0.9 and 0.0005 respectively.</p><p>Selective Search <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[20]</ref>, EdgeBox <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[47]</ref>, and MCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[53]</ref> are adopted to generate about 2, 000 proposals per-image for the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets, respectively. For data augmentation, we use five image scales {480, 576, 688, 864, 1200} (resize the shortest side to one of these scales) with horizontal flips for both training and testing. If not specified, the instance classifiers are refined three times, i.e., K = 3 in Section 3.3, so there are four output streams; the IoU threshold I t in Section 3.4.1 (2) (also Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discussions</head><p>We first conduct some experiments to discuss the influence of different components of our method (including instance classifier refinement, different proposal generation methods, different refinement strategies, and weighted loss) and different parameter settings (including the IoU threshold I t defined in Section 3.4.1 (2), the number of k-means clusters described in Section 3.4.1 (2), the IoU threshold I t defined in Section 3.4.2, and multi-scale training and testing.) We also discuss the number of proposal cluster centers. Without loss of generality, we only perform experiments on the VOC 2007 dataset and use the VGG M model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">The influence of instance classifier refinement</head><p>As the five curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref> show, we observe that compared with the basic MIL network, for both refinement methods, even refining instance classifier a single time boosts the performance a lot. This confirms the necessity of refinement.</p><p>If we refine the classifier multiple times, the results are improved further. But when refinement is implemented too many times, the performance gets saturated (there are no obvious improvements from 3 times to 4 times). This is because the network tends to converge so that the supervision of the 4-th time is similar to the 3-rd time. In the rest of this paper we only refine classifiers 3 times. Notice that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref>, the "0 time" is similar to the WSDDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> using Selective Search as proposals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">The influence of different proposal cluster generation methods</head><p>We discuss the influence of different proposal cluster generation methods. As shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref> (green and purple solid curves for the highest scoring proposal based method, blue and red solid curves for the graph-based method), for all refinement times, the graph-based method obtains better performance, because it can generate better cluster centers.</p><p>Thus we choose the graph-based method in the rest of our paper.  </p></div>

The directly assigning label method is replaced by treating clusters as bags (blue and green solid curves). From In the rest of our paper, we only report results by the "PCL-OB-G" method in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5</ref> because it achieves the best performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">The influence of weighted loss</head><p>We also study the influence of our weighted loss in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(8)</ref>. Note that Eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) can be easily changed to the unweighted version by simply setting λ k r and s k n to be 1. Here we train a network using the unweighted loss. The results of the unweighted loss are mAP 33.6% and CorLoc 51.2%. We see that if we use the unweighted loss, the improvement from refinement is very scant and the performance is even worse than the alternating strategy. Using the weighted loss achieves much better performance (mAP 40.8% and CorLoc 59.6%), which confirms our theory in Section 3.4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">The influence of the IoU threshold I t</head><p>Here we discuss the influence of the IoU threshold I t defined in Section 3.4.1 (2) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">4</ref>). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6</ref>, we see that setting I t to 0.4 obtains the best performance. Therefore, we set I t to 0.4 for the other experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6">The influence of the number of k-means clusters</head><p>In previous experiments we set the number of k-means clusters described in the last paragraph of Section 3.4.1 (2) to be 3. Here we set it to other numbers to explore its influence. The results from other numbers of k-means clusters are mAP 40.2% and CorLoc 59.3% for 2 clusters, and mAP 40.7% and CorLoc 59.6% for 4 clusters, which are a little worse than the results from 3 cluster. Therefore, we set the number of k-means clusters to 3 for the other experiments. We also analyse the influence of I t defined in Section 3.4.2 and the 5-th line of Algorithm 4. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>, I t = 0.5 outperforms other choices. Therefore, we set I t to 0.5 for the other experiments.</p></div>

The single-scale results are mAP 37.4% and CorLoc 55.5% which are much worse than our multi-scale results (mAP 40.8% and CorLoc 59.6%). Therefore, we use five image scales as many WSOD networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>.</p></div>

To make the training more stable in the beginning, for each positive object class we empirically select at most five proposal cluster centers which have higher scores, and the number of selected proposal cluster centers does not influence the performance much.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Comparison with other methods</head><p>Here we compare our best performed strategy PCL-OB-G, i.e., using graph-based method and treating clusters as bags to train the network online, with other methods. We first report our results for each class on VOC 2007 and 2012 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. It is obvious that our method outperforms other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref> using single model VGG M or VGG16 (PCL-OB-G+VGG M and PCL-OB-G+VGG16 in tables.) Our single model results even better than others by combining multiple different models (e.g., ensemble of models) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[54]</ref>. Specially, our method obtains much better results compared with other two methods also using the same basic MIL network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>. Importantly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> also equips the weighted sum pooling with objectness measure of EdgeBox <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[47]</ref> and the spatial regulariser, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref> adds context information into the network, both of which are more complicated than our basic MIL network. We believe that our performance can be improved by choosing better basic MIL networks, like the complete network in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref> and using context information <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>. As reimplementing their method completely is nontrivial, here we only choose the simplest architecture in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>. Even in this simplified case, our method achieves very promising results.</p><p>Our results can also be improved by combing multiple models. As shown in the tables, there are little improvements from the ensemble of the VGG M and VGG16 models (PCL-OB-G-Ens. in tables). Here we do the ensemble by summing up the scores produced by the two models. Also, as mentioned in Section 4.1, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[54]</ref>, we train a FRCNN detector using top-scoring proposals produced by PCL-OB-G-Ens. as groundtruths (PCL-OB-G-Ens.+FRCNN in tables). As we can see, the performance is improved further.</p><p>We then show results of our method on the large scale ImageNet detection dataset in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. We observe similar phenomenon that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin.  We finally report results of our method on MS-COCO in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. Our method obtains better performance than the recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[57]</ref>. In particular, Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[57]</ref> use the method proposed in our conference version paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[21]</ref> as a basic component. We can expect to obtain better detection performance through replacing our conference version method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[57]</ref> by our newly proposed method here, which we would like to explore in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Qualitative results</head><p>We first show some proposal clusters generated by our method in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">8</ref>. As we can see, the cluster centers contain at least parts of objects and are able to cover adaptive number of objects for each class.</p><p>We then show qualitative comparisons among the WS-DDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[17]</ref>, the WSDDN+context <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>, and our PCL method, both of which use the same basic MIL network. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>, we can observe that for classes such as bike, car, cat, etc., our method tends to provide more accurate detections, whereas other two methods sometimes fails by producing boxes that are overlarge or only contain parts of objects (the first four rows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>). But for some classes such as person, our method sometimes fails by only detecting parts of objects such as the head of person (the fifth row in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>). Exploiting context information sometimes help the detection (as in WSDDN+context <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[18]</ref>), we believe our method can be further improved by incorporating context information into our framework. All these three methods (actually almost all weakly supervised object detection methods) suffers from two problems: producing boxes that not only contain the target object but also include their adjacent similar objects, or only detecting parts of object for objects with deformation (the last row in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>). We finally visualize some success and failure detection results on VOC 2007 trainval by PCL-Ens.+FRCNN, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">10</ref>. We observe similar phenomena as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">9</ref>. Our method is robust to the size and aspect of objects, especially for rigid objects. The main failures for these rigid objects are always due to overlarge boxes that not only contain objects, but also include adjacent similar objects. For nonrigid objects like "cat", "dog", and "person", they often have great deformations, but their parts (e.g., head of person) have much less deformation, so our detector is still inclined to find these parts. An ideal solution is yet wanted because there is still room for improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we propose to generate proposal clusters to learn refined instance classifiers for weakly supervised object detection. We propose two strategies for proposal cluster generation and classifier refinement, both of which can boost the performance significantly. The classifier refinement is implemented by multiple output streams corresponding to some instance classifiers in multiple instance learning networks. An online training algorithm is introduced to train the proposed network end-to-end for effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments show substantial and consistent improvements by our method. We observe that the most common failure cases of our algorithm are connected with the deformation of non-rigid objects. In the future, we will concentrate on this problem. In addition, we believe our learning algorithm has the potential to be applied in other weakly supervised visual learning tasks such as weakly supervised semantic segmentation. We will also explore how to apply our method to these related applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

All arrows are utilized during the forward process of training, only the solid ones have back-propagation computations, and only the blue ones are used during testing. During the forward process of training, an image and its proposal boxes are fed into the CNN which involves a series of convolutional layers, an SPP layer, and two fully connected layers to produce proposal features. These proposal features are branched into many streams: the first one for the basic MIL network and the other ones for iterative instance classifier refinement. Each stream outputs a set of proposal scores and generates proposal clusters consequently. Based on these proposal clusters, supervisions are generated to compute losses for the next stream. During the back-propagation process of training, proposal features and classifiers are trained according to the network losses. All streams share the same proposal features.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,48.67,126.39,50.09,75.27" type="bitmap" /></figure>
