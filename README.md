# EneRex++
Final Project for DS605 (Deep Learning for Low Resource NLP) at IIT Bhilai 2023-23M. Our Project is "EneRex++: End to End Entity Research Entity Extraction with contribution", which is an extension of the paper "Lessons from Deep Learning applied to Scholarly Information Extraction: What Works, What Doesnâ€™t, and Future Directions"
